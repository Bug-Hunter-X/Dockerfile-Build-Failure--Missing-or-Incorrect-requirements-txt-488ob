This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: issues with the `requirements.txt` file.  The original Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) contains an error that prevents successful building.  The corrected version (`Dockerfile_fixed`) shows the solution. The error typically manifests as a failure during the `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` stage, indicating that the file is missing or the path is incorrect. The corrected version provides a functional implementation.
